**Signal acquisition**
The acceleration signals measured from the triaxial accelerometer are transmitted to a computer via the wireless module. Users can utilize this digital pen to write digits and make hand gestures at normal speed. The measured acceleration signals of these motions can be recognized by the trajectory recognition algorithm. 

 - Accelerometer: The acceleration signals of hand motions are measured by the pen-type portable device
 - Gyroscope: To improve accelerometer accuracy (not used in the current model)
 - Magnetometer: To recalibrate the sensor (not used in the current model)

**Signal Preprocessing**
The signal preprocessing procedure consists of: 

 - Reduction of Dimension
 - Calibration( to remove drift errors and offsets from the raw signals )
 - A moving average filter( to remove high frequency noise from raw data )
 - A high-pass filter( to remove gravitational acceleration from raw data )
 - Normalization

*The raw acceleration signals of hand motions are generated by the accelerometer and collected by the microcontroller. Due to human nature, our hand always trembles slightly while moving, which causes a certain amount of noise.*

**Feature Generation**
The characteristics of different hand movement signals can be obtained by extracting features from the pre-processed x, y, and z-axis signals

**Image Generation**

 - Converting the pre-processed x, y, and z-axis acceleration signals into discrete position points in a 2D plane using integrals
 - Creating an image after plotting the position points on a 2D plane
 - Resizing the image and converting the image into a monochrome image to fit the input format of the Neural Network
 - Storing the image as an (28,28) array

**Classifier**
The generated image is recognised using a neural network that was trained using the MNIST data set
